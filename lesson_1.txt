1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Organized file differences into easy to read sections to quickly spot differences

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Ability to see what has already been tried, no wasting time repeating code, learn how issues were fixed

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: more control over size of commits, commits are more sensible
Cons: may forget to commit

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

May allow in order for user to see how related files changed together, while others may treat separately to save space?

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows list of changes with IDs, then use git diff with IDs to see differences

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

easy to see where the changes were made and revert to a time when there was no error!

7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

everything!
